    <h2>Information:</h2>
    <p>This video outlines the past tense and when to use it. It also covers certain verb conjugation that only occur in this tense.
     The <strong>simple past</strong> describes an event within a time frame that is completed (compare the simple past "I cooked twice this week" with the present perfect, "I have cooked twice this week" â€” the former implies that that's all the cooking I'm going to do, while the latter leaves open the possibility that I might cook more).
     The <strong>past perfect</strong> tense describes events or situations that precede another point in the past that has been established through the the present perfect or the simple past.
     English creates this tense with a past participle and, as the name suggests, with the auxiliary verb, "to have," conjugated in its past-tense forms.</p>
